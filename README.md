# Input-Audio-Preamplifier-Design-
I designed an input audio preamplifier to process signals from microphones, pickups, radios, and tape recorders. I developed and analyzed amplification stages using BC846B transistors, featuring a common-emitter input and output stage. I implemented negative feedback (series at input, parallel at output) to optimize gain, reduce distortion, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. I simulated the circuit's operation through static operating point (PSF) analysis, transient analysis, and frequency response verification to ensure compliance with design specifications. I created a PCB layout and generated Gerber files for manufacturing, optimizing trace routing for signal integrity. I thoroughly documented the design process, detailing component value calculations, selection of operating parameters, and technical justifications for design choices.
